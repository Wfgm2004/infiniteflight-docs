# 7D.2 Violations



### 7D.2.1

Supervisors are granted the ability to issue Violations as a pilot in order to fulfil their duty of moderating the Infinite Flight Expert Server.



### 7D.2.2

The following are examples of situations where it may be considered appropriate to exercise this ability:

- unmanned airports with no order
- clear violations of Expert Server rules
- environments where IFATC controllers are not enforcing instructions



### 7D.2.3

Violations **must**{.red} be issued for blatant offenses to the point where pilots on the Expert Server are not being negatively affected by the actions of other pilots.		

Taxiing through other aircraft, landing on top of aircraft/failure to go around, going too fast in a controlled environment, and/or other clearly distinguishable acts of interference are some of the most common reasons to issue a Violation in the absence of a Controller. 



### 7D.2.4

Violations can be issued by following the process below:



Step 1

: Tap on the aircraft icon from your map/mini map



Step 2

: The pilot callsign/display name will appear, tap this to open the information tab



Step 3

: Tap the report button and select the reason most appropriate



### 7D.2.5

The pilot(s) have the ability to appeal their Violation via @appeals on the IFC within a 7 day span of time *(see [1B.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1b.-violations/1b.3-incident-resolution-procedure#1b.3.1) above)*. It is strongly recommended that Supervisors have replays of their sessions on hand for that duration in order to deal with inquiries if required. Moderators, the Appeals Team and/or the IFATC Manager reserve the final say on the verdict of appeal(s).
